# FALCON using pbsmrtpipe for workflow
**pbsmrtpipe** would be used to run the tasks and to update the tool-contracts,
but otherwise it is not really needed here.

# Utilities
## canonical.py
This is for making our `*.json` files consistent.
They are stored in package **pbsmrtpipe**.
## pb-ini2xml
This converts our config files to a section of a preset.xml file.
