Overview:
    pbtranscript cluster contains two main components:
    * (1) ICE (iterative clustering and error correction) to predict
      unpolished consensus isoforms.
    * (2) Polish, to use nfl reads and quiver to polish those predicted
      unpolished isoforms. Polish contains three steps:
      + (2.1) IceAllPartials (ice_partial.py all)
              Align and assign nfl reads to unpolished isoforms, and
              save results to a pickle file.
      + (2.2) IceQuiver (ice_quiver.py all)
              Call quiver to polish each isoform based on alignments
              created by mapping its associated fl and nfl reads to
              this isoform.
      + (2.3) IceQuiverPostprocess (ice_quiver.py postprocess)
              Collect and post process quiver results, and classify
              HQ/LQ isoforms.

    In order to handle subtasks by SMRTPipe instead of pbtranscript
    itself, we will refactor the polish phase including
    (2.1) (2.2) and (2.3).

    (2.1) IceAllPartials (ice_partial.py all) will be refactored to
      + (2.1.1) ice_partial.py split
                Split nfl reads into N chunks (N<=100).
      + (2.1.2) ice_partial.py i
                For each chunk i, align and assign its reads to unpolished
                isoforms and create a pickle file.
      + (2.1.3) ice_partial.py merge
                Merge pickles for all splitted chunks together to a
                big pickle.

    *** Here we are focusing on (2.1.3) ice_partial.py merge ***

Description:
    (2.1.3) ice_partial.py merge

    Assumption:
      * Phase (1) ICE is done and unpolished isoforms created.
      * ice_partial.py split has been called to split nfl reads into N chunks
      * ice_partial.py i has been applied to each chunk
      * we will collect and merge pickles for each chunk into a big pickle.

    Process:
        Given root_dir, and N, merge pickles of N chunks of nfl reads into
        a big pickle.

        The pikle file of the i-th chunk is at:
            root_dir/output/map_noFL/input.split_{0:03d}.fasta.partial_uc.pickle

    Input:
      Positional:
        root_dir, an output directory for running pbtranscript cluster.
        N, the number of chunks of nfl reads.

    Output:
        Merge pickles of N nfl reads chunks into a big pickle at:
            root_dir/output/map_noFL/nfl.all.partial_uc.pickle,

    Hierarchy:
        pbtranscript = iceiterative

        pbtranscript --quiver = iceiterative + \
                                ice_polish.py

        ice_polish.py =  ice_make_fasta_fofn.py + \
                         ice_partial.py all + \
                         ice_quiver.py all

        ice_partial.py all = ice_partial.py split + \
                             ice_partial.py i + \
                             ice_partial.py merge

        (ice_partial.py one --> only apply ice_partial on a given input fasta)

        ice_quiver.py all = ice_quiver.py i + \
                            ice_quiver.py merge + \
                            ice_quiver.py postprocess

    Example:
        ice_partial.py merge root_dir N

Alternative way to call this script:
    python -m pbtranscript.ice_partial merge
