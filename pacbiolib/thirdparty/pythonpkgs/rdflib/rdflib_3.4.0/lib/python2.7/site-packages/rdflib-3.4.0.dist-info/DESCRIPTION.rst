RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful
language for representing information.

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
NTriples, Turtle, TriX, RDFa and Microdata . The library presents a Graph
interface which can be backed by any one of a number of Store
implementations. The core rdflib includes store implementations for
in memory storage and persistent storage on top of the Berkeley DB.

The rdfextras project offers several additional stores as well as a
SPARQL engine for use with rdflib: http://github.com/RDFLib/rdfextras/

If you have recently reported a bug marked as fixed, or have a craving for
the very latest, you may want the development version instead:
